# docs/diagrams Directory

## Purpose
Visual assets and source diagrams for flows, state machines, and network topologies.

## How to Use
Store Mermaid/PlantUML sources plus exported PNG/SVG for docs site.

## Naming Conventions
mainhub-flow.mmd, deployment-sequence.puml.

## Coding Rules
Prefer text-based diagrams for version control friendliness.

## Scaling Notes
Add diagrams for each subsystem or module group as they launch.

## Security Notes
Only include conceptual data; omit secrets or real addresses.

## Codex/Cursor Automation
CI can convert .mmd/.puml to PNG for documentation releases.

## Example
leaderboard-sequence.mmd
